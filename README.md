E-Yantra is a Robotics competition organised by IIT BOMBAY. There is qualifire rounds and virtual implementation of a theme. On the basis of performance they choose the teams and provide them materials to complete the project practically.

The following source is also available on google-drive link:
Another google drive link because videos can be played there easily.

During this project we understood ROS(Robotics Operating System), basics of VREP, Image processing, Whycon Marker and pid tuning and its implementation.

Three main source codes of this projects are:
  1. Image Processing: https://github.com/Keshari0601/eyrc/blob/master/E-YRC%20src/pollinator_bee/scritps/task_1.2.py
  2. Drone Controller: https://github.com/Keshari0601/eyrc/blob/master/E-YRC%20src/pollinator_bee/scritps/task_1.1.py
  3. Whycon Remapping: https://github.com/Keshari0601/eyrc/blob/master/E-YRC%20src/whycon.launch
