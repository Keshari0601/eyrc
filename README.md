Another google drive link because videos can be played there easily.

During this project we understood ROS(Robotics Operating System), basics of VREP, Image processing, Whycon Marker and pid tuning and its implementation.

Three main source codes of this projects are:
  1. Image Processing: https://github.com/Keshari0601/eyrc/blob/master/E-YRC%20src/pollinator_bee/scritps/task_1.2.py
  2. Drone Controller: https://github.com/Keshari0601/eyrc/blob/master/E-YRC%20src/pollinator_bee/scritps/task_1.1.py
  3. Whycon Remapping: https://github.com/Keshari0601/eyrc/blob/master/E-YRC%20src/whycon.launch
